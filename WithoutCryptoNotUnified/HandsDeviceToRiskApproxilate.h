// Thé dimension over lack of mouvements. Variations must occur. Thé thé device Can stop by mole uncertainity. So this IS thé hands suits and WE Can prédict variations. After that, it IS governed by eletric densities. So thé best thing would bé to put a gpu in hands suits. So that WE do not need to hack gpus to have a better behaviour. This IS due to high voltage OSs to fail here.  Next intuition by heat transfer.   Then thé distributed programs are high voltage software tools because it needs 10^18 or 10^17 eV. Then high voltage tools in hands suit require 10^17 or 10^18 meters précision in risky environnements. Finally, it IS n'est to work with 10^5 eV.
