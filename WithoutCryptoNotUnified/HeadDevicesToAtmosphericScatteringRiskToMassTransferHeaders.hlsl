//firet of all, letd see my graphic engine september 2025
//then see neiji93 graphic engine beyond ...
//it seems the headers here cannot use approximate algorithms or models.
//and we cannot linkntheo to high voltage OSs.
//so lets use signals ui/ux znd stacks on hds because
//we dont deal with tokens in this repository.
//that said, it means that the gpu architectures could be old because
//gpu caches are small and those devices here dont need several probes.
//remelber that some other devices use 10^5 eV systems. then limiting probes in the body
//can be good.

//enabling roughness is a risk because in the neiji93 repositories
,several assumptions were made for it.
  //then here gram is suited for old gpu czches.
