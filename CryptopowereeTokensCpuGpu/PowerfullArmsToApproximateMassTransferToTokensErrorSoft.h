//soft heat transfer can occur here. it id best to enable models.
//this is also the bezt way to deal with crypto tokens because the chest is empty
//and head doesnt have high range of orobes.
//to be more clear, this is a choice but the hdd in chest are secure and
//the models do not run on chest suit..this is a second interesting point.
