//if we dont deal with chest second bios s, we can
//prevent 2 cpu messages. then contracts are the keys with tokens.
//as every containers in a same manner. so as we fullfill crypto
//requirements, we can easily use linux scheduller.
//after that, the cpu processes mustnt use async keyword.
//then, as we fullfill our stuff with cyber decurity neiji93 in github, we can use
//at least 20 000 probed in lungs (linux max processes). plus,
//the engeneering process tells us that this is the same
//without tokens. so we can use at least 40 000 probes. but here
//the best choice would be to use 2500 probes like in chest beczuse we
//have to trst our programs (cyber decurity, subsystems). plus, we cannot prevent high speed schedulling.
